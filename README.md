This Website name is Dialz. As through, this is a full-stack website it has two sites. 1.Client site 2. server site. Making Client site is used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, React JS, React Router, Reack-HooK form & FireBase Authentication. Making Backend site is used node JS, express, mongodb etc. In this Website We used data from MongoDB. The Services part will update dynamically if you wanted to show a single service information, click on service button showing details.This is completely responsive. As it was styled with bootstrap. This site was deployed on FireBase. The link is provided in the top. The only bug of this site is that you can hire a single developer multiple times in a single project. That is unrealistic.

In the project, we used: The website ideas are collected from Themeforst website & taken image from unsplash, icon from flat-icon & font-awesome. Used Roboto font from google. This was my Second offical project on node, MongoDB & Express. I used private route. React-authentication & private route used from Firebase. I used Bootstrap to style the whole project. Some Pure CSS was used in this project!

<!-- ## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
